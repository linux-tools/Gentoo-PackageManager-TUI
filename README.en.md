# Gentoo-PackageManager

#### Description

Gentoo-PackageManager,a package TUI manager of portage by C programing,is included many useful functions,ranging from checking installed packages,updating system to editing repository.

#### Software Architecture

In terms of source portability,the software theoretically support all architectures.

#### Installation

Install dependencies:
app-eselect/eselect-repository,app-portage/gentoolkit app-admin/sudo,app-text/tree

Please execute "emerge --ask app-eselect/eselect-repository app-portage/gentoolkit" to install dependencies.

install:
Please execute "make && make install" to build and install gentoo-packagemanager.
You can remove /usr/bin/gentoo-packagemanager to uninstall.

#### Instructions

Please enter numbers and do not enter strings at random.
Considering that it is used on the server, it temporarily supports English! Chinese follow-up support (please run under X11, wayland or a terminal that supports Chinese for the Chinese version).
Please follow the menu prompts.

#### About Portage knowledges

USE,ACCEPT_KEYWORDS,MASK tags are important part in Gentoo GNU/Linux or Musl C  version of the Gentoo Linux that can control package installing,upgrading,downgrading,masking and blocking operations.(Most of the images come from Gentoo user forums, and a few come from Baidu Tieba and other sources)

USE:
USE tags can customize the features of packages,which determines whether the software you install can be acquired and installed in binary form and determines how many features are included in the software you install. By adding or removing USE tags, the dependencies of the package may be increased or reduced, and the value appreciation will lead to the circular dependency of the package, which will bring unnecessary trouble to the system update.Even package dependency conflicts can occur due to USE tags, causing system updates to fail

e.g.

ACCEPT_KEYWORDS:
When installing Gentoo, ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="amd64" or ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64" will appear when selecting a stable or unstable branch of the software, which decide how often the system or software is updated. Some software is also blocked for this reason, and it is possible to install the blocked package by manually modifying the ACCEPT_KEYWORDS.

e.g.

MASK:
With the MASK tag,we can lock the version of a package or block packages that we don't need. However, for system updates, this operation is more dangerous, and you need to consider the dependency problems caused by USE tags.The masking of packages is related to ACCEPT_KEYWORDS tags.

e.g.
